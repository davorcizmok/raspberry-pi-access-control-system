# OVERVIEW
###############################################################################
#
# This code sits in a loop waiting for cards to be presented. When the card
# is presented, the ID of the card is read and then checked against an
# access control list.
#
# If the card is in the access control list, a physical hardware GPIO pin is
# raised on the Raspberry Pi. This pin generally triggers a relay, which
# will then enable a device, open a door, or similar.
#
# When the card is removed, the GPIO pin is dropped, turning off the relay
# and disabling the door.
#

#
# Card Presentation - Hardware
# ----------------------------
#
# When an access card is presented to a hardware card-reader, it signals this
# to the Raspberry Pi by 'raising' a GPIO pin. Note that this is a different
# GPIO pin to the one referred to above (the 'control' GPIO pin).
#
# This 'card presented' pin acts as a signal to this program to execute the
# card reader code, which then reads the presented card ID through the
# i2c protocol.
#
# When the pin 'falls', it means the card has been removed from the proximity
# of the card reader. When that occurs, we call the Reader object code that
# will disable the device / close the door.
#

#
# Underlying Operating System Concepts
# ------------------------------------
#
# GPIO in Linux is managed through reading/writing files. Once opened,
# these files are effectively normal Unix filedescriptors.
# 
# The quick2wire-python-api code abstracts away the filedescriptor
# access to a 'Pin' object. These objects can be used with the 'select'
# or 'epoll' posix call to handle events, such as the pin going 'high'
# or 'low'.
#
# Most of the code in the this file relates to reading in the configuration
# file and building a series of in-memory objects that represent the desired
# config.
#
# This code then creates 'Pin' objects to match the configuration objects,
# and then uses 'epoll(7)' to watch for state changes on the Pins. When the
# pins change state, this code calls methods on the Objects, which then read
# the card and enable/disable the attached hardware Devices.
